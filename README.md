# Forecasting Daily COVID-19 Cases using ARIMA Model
This paper presents a comparative study of forecasting techniques for the prediction of daily Covid – 19 cases. Various techniques have been analyzed after going through literature surveys and the best technique have been implemented to accurately predict various factors such as new deaths and new cases. In this project, we are comparing two prediction techniques for Forecasting Daily COVID – 19 Cases which are ARIMA model and Moving Average method. These techniques have been implemented assuring the major factors being capacity, robustness and the precision. The proposed methods have been compared against statistical parameters like mean absolute error (MAE). The experimental results suggest that using a particular method is subjective to its application.
